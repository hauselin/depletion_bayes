# Dataset variables

See `.csv` files for datasets and corresponding `.md` for documentation

Note: The `pNo` variable in all dataset is the participant ID. For studies 3 and 4 (`study == 3` or `study == 4`), the participant IDs have been "encrypted"/anonymized (i.e., the IDs look like Amazon MTurk Worker IDs, but they aren't the original IDs.)
